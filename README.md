Using our Current Titles table that shows all the current employees and their titles there are a total of 240,124 current total employees at the company and 72,458 or 30% of the total employees will be retiring! 

Based on this table showing all the current employees if we subtract the retiring employees we will have enough people to cover the silver wave.
